# UC Upgrade Utilities

This repo contains various functions and utilities for UC Upgrade.
## Latest working version

Please note that current project statis is 🏗️ **WIP**, but we have a minimal set of already working utilities.

** For now please switch to the `v0.0.1` tag in the GitHub to get the latest working version.** 

## Local setup

- Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- Run `poetry install` in the project directory
- Pin your IDE to use the newly created poetry environment

> Please note that you **don't** need to use `poetry` inside notebooks or in the Databricks workspace. 
> It's only introduced to simplify local development.
